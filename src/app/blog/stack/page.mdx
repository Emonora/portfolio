# Stacks

We know 'em, we love 'em, we stack 'em.

## The Stack

The Stack is a collection of technologies that we use to build our applications. It's a way to make our applications, "applications", using things like [sanity.io](https://sanity.io) for CRUD, [next.js](https://nextjs.org) for the frontend, and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.

But seriously, why are these such a commidity?

## Why do we stack?

Well, the only real answer I can give you, is that it's how we roll. It's how we build our projects, we use the tools in our stack.

I'll be honest, I don't have a stack of my own, I just use the t3 stack (As I'm a next.js dev)

## My modified stack

I've modified the t3 stack slighty to fit my needs, however, it's still mostly the same as before. All I added was [sanity.io](https://sanity.io) as a headless CMS, and cut out the db part of the stack, as I don't need it as of writing this.

## My future stack ideas

You've read this far, good job! I'm sure you're not wondering what my future stack will look like, but I'll tell you anyway. 

So far, I've been using the t3 stack (thanks theo!), but I think it might be time to change that. 

I've created this little idea in my head, and I think its pretty cool.

### The idea

My simple stack idea, is quite simple, and I think it's pretty cool.
I'll call it the "a3 stack", a simple fork of the t3 stack.

Here's what it'll look like:

- Next.js
    - React
- Tailwind CSS
- Sanity.io
- Typescript
- TRPC

and thats it. Simple, right?

### Why the name?

The name "a3" is short and simple, and it stands for "app 3", because this is my third iteration of stack ideas.

### Why the idea?

Well, I'm not sure why I'm doing this, but I think it's cool, and I think it might be cool to see what happens.

If you're interested in seeing what happens, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this idea.

## Closing thoughts

As uncertain as this idea is, I'm sure it'll be a good one. I'm excited to see what happens with it, and I'd love for you to join me on this journey!
